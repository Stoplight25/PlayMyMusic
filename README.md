# PlayMyMusic
creates a file on your desktop that when clicked plays a random song from a folder. requires python 3.4 and mplayer

after adding music files to the program, DO NOT RENAME THEM.
to add new songs put the songs in the addNewSongs folder and click the .bat file in that folder
FILENAMES MUST NOT CONTAIN SPACES OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS

first, click writeMyBash.bat (emphisis on the .bat ending NOT the python file)
this will make a playMusic.bat file. put that on your desktop.
put your mp3/mp4 files in the addSongs folder, remember, NO SPACES/SPECIAL CHARACTERS
click addSongs.bat 
now just click on the playMusic file to play a random song!

if you must move this folder to another part of your computer delete the numbered bash files in musicmixbash and move all song files to add songs. also delete your play music.bat file. move the folder, run writemybash.bat and then add songs.bat
