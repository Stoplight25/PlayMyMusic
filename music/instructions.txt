to add new songs put the songs in add new songs and click the .bat file in that folder
FILENAMES MUST NOT CONTAIN SPACES OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS
DONT RE-NAME ANY FILES!!!!!!!!!!!

first, set writeMyBash.bat and addSongs.bat as exectable (either via commands or just by right clicking on them, selecting properties, and check the box for making it executable)
click writeMyBash.bat (emphisis on the .bat ending)
this will make a playMusic.bat file. put that on your desktop.
put your mp3/mp4 files in the addSongs folder, remember, NO SPACES/SPECIAL CHARACTERS
click addSongs.bat 
now just click on the playMusic file to play a random song!
